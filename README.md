<h1>Assignment 1</h1>

<h4>My personal information:</h4>
<p>My name is Suzhi Li and my student ID is s3789222. s3789222@student.rmit.edu.au is my study email address but in my personal time, I like to use 1732709168@qq.com and a1732709168@gmail.com. I come from China. If you cannot or find it difficult to say my name, you can call me ‘Sushi’, it is my English name. It is a bit interesting how it became my English name. When I studied in Singapore, the teachers were difficult to say my original name so they chose a similar word, ‘sushi’, to call me. I did not know the meaning at that time and when I knew that meaning, it was too late. However, ‘Sushi’ is good and I like sushi so it became my English name. My hobbies are quite extensive, I like to play video games, watch anime, cook food, do some exercise, read books and even try to write some stories. I am passionate about completing the work which I am doing. In other words, it may be difficult to start a work but if I begin to do it, I can keep paying attention to it until it finishes or my mind protests. I did not study too much about Information Technology, so I am looking forward to learn more about it in further study.
