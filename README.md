<h2>Suzhi Li</h2>
<h3>S3789222</h3>


<h4>My personal information:</h4>
<p>My name is Suzhi Li and my student ID is s3789222. s3789222@student.rmit.edu.au is my study email address but in my personal time, I like to use 1732709168@qq.com and a1732709168@gmail.com. I come from China. If you cannot or find it difficult to say my name, you can call me ‘Sushi’, it is my English name. It is a bit interesting how it became my English name. When I studied in Singapore, the teachers were difficult to say my original name so they chose a similar word, ‘sushi’, to call me. I did not know the meaning at that time and when I knew that meaning, it was too late. However, ‘Sushi’ is good and I like sushi so it became my English name. My hobbies are quite extensive, I like to play video games, watch anime, cook food, do some exercise, read books and even try to write some stories. I am passionate about completing the work which I am doing. In other words, it may be difficult to start a work but if I begin to do it, I can keep paying attention to it until it finishes or my mind protests. I did not study too much about Information Technology, so I am looking forward to learn more about it in further study.

<h4>Interest in IT:</h4>
<p>Just like I say before, I do not know much about Information Technology, the only understanding about IT is that it is about data transmission, reserve, management and communication. Based on these features, it can be dispersed to many different parts like economy, engineering, social and the part that I most interes, game design. I like video games from a very young age, maybe five years old but at that time, the interes only rested on playing it. The interest turned from ‘play’ to ‘design’ at my high school. At seventeen years old, I transferred to Overseas Family School in Singapore from China. In that school, my teacher gave me a sheet to let me choose which subject I wanted to study. Then, I began to think about what I want to do in the future and in that time, I understood I wanted to create some interesting, meaningful, popular games. After that, I tried to study some knowledge about game design, I learned some skills and knowledge about 3D models created by myself, but I knew it is not enough, I have so much need to learn. That is why I design to study Information Technology.

<p>One reason why I choose to study in RMIT is by my best friend’s recommendation. In my high school, we lived together in the same host family. He knew my goal and tried to help me.  He found RMIT on the internet and referrals to me. Then I began to search for information about RMIT. I found that RMIT has the subject that I need and it is at the top of the world. Thus I design to study in RMIT. The funny thing is I try to invite other friends to come with me and they answer me ‘yes’ but in the end, only me come here, I feel pitiful for them because they miss a good University. it is their loss.
